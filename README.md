## Hobbies
My favorite thing to do is to work with computers. I enjoy learning how to code in different ways, and I enjoy building computers. My current rig consists of a Ryzen 7 3700x, RTX 3070 Ti, 16 GB DDR4-3600 RAM, 1TB Intel 660p M.2 NVME SSD, 2TB Seagate Barracuda 7200 RPM HDD, and a Gigabyte Aorus Elite Wifi X570 Motherboard.

## Services
If you are local, I will build your computer for you, as long as you provide the parts and an additional 20 dollars. NO HARDLINE WATER COOLING!!! Hardline water cooling is hard. Softline Water Cooling will be a 50 dollar build fee, with each component after the CPU and GPU being 10 additional dollars.
