## About me
My favorite thing to do is to work with computers. I enjoy learning how to code in different ways, and I enjoy building computers. My current rig consists of a Ryzen 7 3700x, RTX 3070 Ti, 16 GB DDR4-3600 RAM, 1TB Intel 660p M.2 NVME SSD, 2TB Seagate Barracuda 7200 RPM HDD, and a Gigabyte Aorus Elite Wifi X570 Motherboard. Here is a PcPartPickerLink: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/vzzQmk](url). Also, attached below is 

I also enjoy playing the guitar. I play a Yamaha Pacifica 112v Electric Guitar, and I have it connected to a Fender Mustang Amp and a BOSS SD-1 Overdrive pedal. I like playing classic rock hits from the 70's and 80's. 

I am currently a sophomore at my High School. In fact the reason I created this website is for my favorite class that I have taken by far, AP Computer Science.
